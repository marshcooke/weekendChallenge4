#Weekend Challenge 4: The Gallery of My Life

We're switching up our client-side this weekend with Angular! Our focus will be on getting comfortable with what Angular can do for us, so most of our effort will be on client-side JavaScript and, hopefully, experimenting with CSS.

[X] This weekend's application will be a gallery of 6 or more pictures of significance to you. 
[X] When someone clicks on a picture, they should see a brief synopsis of why you chose to display that photo. 
[X] Users can also heart/thumbs up/favorite your photo as many times as they want; 
[X] you'll need to keep track of how many times it was clicked.

#Technologies

[X] Node/Express - to serve your files
[X] Angular - client-side logic
[X] CSS - flex your style muscles
[ ] Heroku - to make your site available to the world (Pro Mode)

#Hints

[X] Explore built-in Angular functionality like ng-click, ng-src, ng-show, ng-hide, ng-if.
[X] Use arrays and objects to store your data on the server.

#Hard Mode

[ ] Create a form that will take comments for each of your photos. 
[ ] Display the comments when a "Show Comments" button is clicked.

#Pro Mode

[ ] Use Angular's $http service to store your data on the server instead of the client. 
[ ] Try and deploy your site to Heroku. This is new, follow the guide in the originial readme for tips.
